# Local Storage Theme todos
This repository demonstrates how to save user data into the local storage. 

I received this project half coded and completely styled. 
My work was to code and complete the task in regards to user, theme and todos in the Localstorage.
My share of the code uses React hooks like useEffect, useState, useContext.

# Themed TODO

1. Figure out how to start the app and login - you will have to study the existing code a bit
2. Implement the theme switcher using contexts
3. The theme should affect the App background color AND the TodoListItems background color
4. No CSS changes should be necessary, unless you really really want to

Remember to commit and push your work before looking at the boonus tasks!

**BONUS 1** Make the login persistent (make the website remember your login even if you refresh the page)
